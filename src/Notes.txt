for redirection in react-router-dom
while at the top of a react component use the useNavigate hook while will allow you to be able to naviagate/redirect 
inside of a helper function like handleSubmit that's inside of our component

while inside of JSX use the Component <Navigate to />
A <Navigate> element changes the current location when it is rendered.
It's a component wrapper around useNavigate, and accepts all the same arguments as props.\


while inside of one of react-router-dom data layer api (loader/action) use redirect method
